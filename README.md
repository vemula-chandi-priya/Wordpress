d. Next, choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). The AMI you choose will determine the base software that is installed on your new EC2 instance. This includes the operating system (Amazon Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, Microsoft Server, etc.), and the applications that are installed on the machine.

Many AMIs are general-purpose AMIs for running many different applications, but some are purpose-built for specific use cases, such as the Deep Learning AMI or various AWS Marketplace AMIs.

WordPress image is certified by Bitnami as secure, up-to-date, and packaged using industry best practices, and approved by Automattic, the experts behind WordPress, so choose WordPress Certified by Bitnami and Automattic after make search on AWS Marketplace AMIs in the AMI selection view.

Choosing an instance type
Scroll down to select an EC2 instance type. An instance type is a particular configuration of CPU, memory (RAM), storage, and network capacity.

AWS has a huge selection of instance types that cover many different workloads. Some are geared toward memory-intensive workloads, such as databases and caches, while others are aimed at compute-heavy workloads, such as image processing or video encoding.

Amazon EC2 allows you to run 750 hours per month of a t2.micro instance under the AWS Free Tier.

But in this image .. AMI vendor recommends using t3a.small instance

a. Select the t3a.small instance.

Configuring a security group and launching your instance
You need to configure a security group before launching your instance. Security groups are networking rules that describe the kind of network traffic that is allowed to your EC2 instance. You want to allow traffic to your instance:

SSH traffic from all IP addresses so you can use the SSH protocol to log in to your EC2 instance and configure WordPress.
HTTPS traffic from all IP addresses so that users can view your WordPress site Secured.
HTTP traffic from all IP addresses so that users can view your WordPress site.
a. To configure this, select Allow SSH traffic from Anywhere and select Allow HTTPS & HTTP traffic from the internet (These are the default choices when choosing an Wordpress AMI).
